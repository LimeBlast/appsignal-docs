## Installation

Add the `@appsignal/react` and `@appsignal/javascript` packages to your `package.json`. Then, run `npm install`/`yarn install`.

You can also add these packages to your `package.json` on the command line:

```sh
yarn add @appsignal/javascript @appsignal/react
npm install --save @appsignal/javascript @appsignal/react
```

## Usage

### Error Boundary

If you are using React v16 or higher, you can use the `ErrorBoundary` component to catch errors from anywhere in the child component tree.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Appsignal from "@appsignal/javascript";
import { ErrorBoundary } from "@appsignal/react";

const appsignal = new Appsignal({
  key: "YOUR FRONTEND API KEY"
});

const FallbackComponent = () => (
  <div>Uh oh! There was an error :(</div>
);

const App = () => (
  <ErrorBoundary
    instance={appsignal}
    tags={{ tag: "value" }} {/* Optional */}
    fallback={(error) => <FallbackComponent />} {/* Optional */}
  >
    { /** Child components here **/}
  </ErrorBoundary>
);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### Legacy Boundary

!> The API that this component uses is unstable at this point in React's development. We offer this component as a means to support those running React v15, but do not guarantee its reliablity. You are encouraged to use the `ErrorBoundary` whenever possible.

The `LegacyBoundary` works in almost exactly the same way as the `ErrorBoundary`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Appsignal from "@appsignal/javascript";
import { LegacyBoundary } from "@appsignal/react";

const appsignal = new Appsignal({
  key: "YOUR FRONTEND API KEY",
});

const FallbackComponent = () => <div>Uh oh! There was an error :(</div>;

const App = () => (
  <LegacyBoundary
    instance={appsignal}
    fallback={(error) => <FallbackComponent />}
  >
    {/** Child components here **/}
  </LegacyBoundary>
);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
