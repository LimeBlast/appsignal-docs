title: "Add method instrumentation"
---

-> ℹ️  Notes:  
-> - This feature is available since Ruby gem version 1.3 and only works for classes.  
-> - Ruby 3.0 support for keyword arguments was added in Ruby gem `2.11.4`.

Sometimes [instrumentation blocks](/ruby/instrumentation/instrumentation.html) are not accurate enough. Every application is different, and so is the code that runs it. Developers know what code and, more accurately, what methods to instrument.

It's possible to instrument methods in your Ruby code directly with AppSignal.
Using the `appsignal` Ruby gem you can use our object integrations which
provides you with some useful helpers to do so.

## Installation

Activate the object integration by requiring the following line after loading
the appsignal gem itself

```ruby
require 'appsignal/integrations/object'
```

and proceed to specify which methods you want to test on any class you want.

### Example

```ruby
require 'appsignal'
require 'appsignal/integrations/object'

class Foo
  def bar
    1
  end
  appsignal_instrument_method :bar

  def self.bar
    2
  end
  appsignal_instrument_class_method :bar
end

Foo.new.bar
# => 1
Foo.bar
# => 2
```

## Usage

We have different helpers for instance methods and class methods,
`appsignal_instrument_method` and `appsignal_instrument_class_method`
respectively.

Call them on class level in any Ruby class, even those from the Ruby standard
library, and start instrumenting. You don't need to include anything else in
the class, once you load the integration file it becomes available everywhere.

Instrument any method by calling the helper with the name of the method
you want to instrument. If the method does not exist, it will throw
an error, just like Ruby would do by default.

Once a request has been processed by AppSignal with this type of
instrumentation you will be able to see the method instrumentation in the event
breakdown on the sample page.

You're also able to customize the name of the event that's send to us using the
`:name` option.

```ruby
class Foo
  def bar
  end
  appsignal_instrument_method :bar

  def self.bar
  end
  appsignal_instrument_class_method :bar, name: "bar.class_method.Foo.methods"
end
```
